<h3>Acceleo - transforming models into code</h3>
<div id="introText">
<p class="left"> <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a> is a pragmatic implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) MOF Model to Text Language (MTL) standard.
You do not need to be an expert to start using the plug-ins and create your first code generator : using the provided example projects
 </p>
<p class="right">and the powerful completion feature of the Acceleo editor, it is very easy to get started once you understand the basic principles.
More information is available on the wiki page for <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a>.</p>

<h3>From Acceleo.org to Eclipse.org </h3>
<div id="introText">
<p class="left"> <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo.org</a> was created 4 years ago, and as the time goes, the Team has been 
more and more convinced that the MOF Model To Text OMG specification was the way to go for the project. We started to code a reference 
implementation for the standard within the Eclipse M2T project. We have managed to provide nice tooling, simple syntax and efficient code 
generation with all the pragmatism we had about Acceleo.org. There aren't a lot of differences between the old version of acceleo and the 
new one.<br />
For Acceleo lover, you will find in Eclipse Acceleo everything you have loved in the Acceleo.org version and more. This specification is
 really a good one
 </p>
<p class="right"> <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/">http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/</a>.
At the moment, those who need a perfect stability must continue to use the Acceleo.org version (2.x). As time goes on, Eclipse Acceleo is 
better and better and you can already have a try right now (0.8 and 0.9). That said, we still need some few month to get the same stability 
level between our current stable version and the new one. The next generation Acceleo will be ready for the next Eclipse simultaneous release 
(Helios). For Helios, this is the first time we plan to graduate under Eclipse. We also plan to grow the version number from 0.9.0 to 3.0.0 
because the last release of Acceleo outside of Eclipse was the 2.6.0 version. </p>

<h3>...and yet powerful</h3>


<div id="feature_left">

<h4>EMF Read/Write</h4>
<p>Xtext can read and write textual models into <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf">Ecore meta models</a> be
they dynamic or static.</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_middle">
<h4>Semantic Models</h4>
<p>When loading textual models Xtext <a href="/Xtext/documentation/latest/xtext.html#concepts">establishes crosslinks</a> where
needed. Doing so your objects build an interconnected domain model.</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_right">
<h4>Code Generation</h4>
<p>
As part of <a href="http://www.openArchitectureWare.org">openArchitectureWare</a> Xtext
integrates with EMF-based code generator frameworks and is fully supported by <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Xpand">Xpand</a>.
</p>
</div>


<div id="feature_total">
<h4>User Experience</h4>
<p>
Editors created with Xtext support the author of textual models with features like
content assist and template proposals in a way you know from modern IDEs.
Semantic syntax highlighting, an outline view or hyperlinks simplify the navigation effort and make working with text files great fun.
Constraint violations will show up as markers in the editor and in the Eclipse problems view as you type.

		Developing Domain Specific Languages
	</a>
Sven and Heiko (supported by Sebastian and Moritz via the chat) explain what DSLs are and how you can benefit from them in today's software development projects.
Language development is no longer rocket science.
To prove this, they demonstrate how to implement a DSL for Chess. They continue with technical details.
The webinar closes with some more advanced show cases to give a glimpse of what Xtext is able to do.
