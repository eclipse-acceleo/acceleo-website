		<h3>About Acceleo</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a> is a pragmatic implementation of the <a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group (OMG)</a> <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/">MOF Model to Text Language (MTL)</a> standard. You do not need to be an expert to start using the plug-ins and create your first code generator : using the provided example projects and the powerful completion feature of the Acceleo editor, it is very easy to get started and understand the basic principles.
		</p>
	    <p>
			Acceleo is the result of several man-years of R&amp;D started in the French company Obeo. Junction between the OMG MTL standard, its team's experience with industrial code generation and the latest research advances into the M2T field, it offers outstanding advantages : High ability to customize, Interoperability, Easy kick off, and much more!

		<h3>From Acceleo.org to Eclipse.org</h3>
  	 	<p>
			The <a href="http://acceleo.org/pages/home">Acceleo</a> project was started 4 years ago. Over the years, it steadily grew from its first stable release up to its 2.x versions. Yet, the team has been more and more convinced that the future of code generation lied in the OMG <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/">MTL</a> specification, and that it was the way to go for the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reference implementation we provide within the Eclipse M2T project, Acceleo 3, combines nice tooling, simple syntax and efficient code generation with all the pragmatism we had with the 2.x stream.
