<h3>Professional Support</h3>
<p>
	The Acceleo team can be contacted through the official Eclipse M2T forums and newsgroup. Yet this form of support
	may not meet daily needs of an enterprise adopter as far as response delays are involved.
	<br/>
	Most of the developpers of Acceleo are from Obeo, and are then the best source to provide
	<a href="http://www.obeo.fr/pages/maintenance-and-support/">competent and professional support</a> :
	<ul>
		<li>On demand support (based on hour consumption)</li>
		<li>Long term support (integration and maintenance inside your Eclipse bundle)</li>
		<li>Coaching</li>
		<li>Creation of your own generators</li>
	</ul>
	Other professional experts and integrators joined the <a href="http://www.obeonetwork.org/">Obeo Network</a> in order
	to provide service and ready-to-use generators on modeling environments based on Acceleo.

<h3>Training</h3>
The team also offers training courses on Acceleo and its related technologies; the list can be seen
